# Generic-web
Generic web server setup, intended to be used for React applications. Works as a single page application utilizing React-router.

The philosophy is that the web rendering should be completely detached from the api server, in a way replicating mobile clients. No sessions are used - only http bearer tokens.

# Instructions
Install node packages: `npm install`

Run: `npm start`
